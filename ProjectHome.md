Having a drum kit is not easy because it's expensive, noisy and it occupies a lot of space. This project aims to develop a software solution that provides a realistic drum playing experience to allow drummers and drummers-wanna-be to test their skills. For that reason, Microsoft Kinect will be used for arm motion detection and ezdrummer to produce realistic drum sounds. The user will be able to configure his drum kit by adding or removing cymbals, toms or snares. This application will also be an interactive learning platform for noobs who are having their first experience playing drums.
